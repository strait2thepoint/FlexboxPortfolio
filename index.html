            <p><b>Throughout</b> my life I have had many opportunities for unique learning.  It has been my privilege to walk beside many women escaping intimate partner violence.  I have owned my own business designing and making products for those with medical disabilities. I have had my own struggles with chronic illness, which has made me more aware of those with invisible disabilities.  Thanks to my children, I have learned about autism, ADHD and the struggles that LGBTQ teenagers face in their families and lives.  I spend part of every day advocating for marginalized people groups, those caught in abusive situations and teaching people about various forms of oppression that they face.  Through this process, I have learned to embrace and love every part of me, knowing that my faults lead to more learning opportunities and my strengths can be used to benefit others.  I have always had a love of puzzles and problem solving.  The life I have lived has given me creative ways of approaching problems and artistic, yet practical solutions.  As I learn to code, my artistic expression can only grow with the tools I discover along the way. </p>
