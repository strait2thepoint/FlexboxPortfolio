# Strait2thePointPortfolio

## Description
Welcome to Strait2thePointPortfolio!
- By building this website, I really wanted to incorporate the lessons that I have learned through MSU bootcamp and use some of my artistic background by setting the theme of the website using my own photos.
- As I grow as a developer, I hope to update this project with more of the ideas I have to showcase my talents as a creative artist, a problem solver and a developer.  In the future, I would like to have the images not only go opaque with a mouse hover, but also change to the picture of the project that is being featured.  There are so many more concepts I wanted to try with this site, but did not have the ability to do them all yet.  
- This site gives me a great canvas to showcase my projects in a fun and engaging way.
- I learned that I need to study more about flexboxes and containers.
